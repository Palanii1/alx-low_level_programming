Program 1 test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
Program 2 was debugged by commenting out parts of the code causing an infinite loop
Program 3 was fixed so that it always correctly prints out the largest 3 numbers no matter the case
Program 4 was fixed so the output works correctly for all dates and leap years. This program converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration
